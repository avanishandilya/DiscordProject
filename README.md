# DiscordProject
Discord is a messaging app that people use to connect with each other. It has grown in popularity over the years (Source 1). Personally, I have been a part of that growth in the past couple years. It interested me that around the same time the pandemic started, more and more people were joining Discord.  

I became interested in trends of Discord servers. It was very interesting to see patterns as time goes on. Therefore, I decided to create my own dataset and analyze the data with Python and Pandas.

## Goals of the Project 
The goal of the project was to do exploratory analysis. Additionally, gain new skills in data analysis. 
A more personal goal was to see the interactions of people and find noticeable trends in interactions as time goes on. 

## Plan for the Project 
The general plan of the project was: 
1. Find a question to answer 
2. Collect Data 
3. Demonstrate skills
4. Analyze the data 
5. Answer the Question 

## Question for the Project 
Although there weren't any specific groups of people I wasn't giving an answer to, my main question was:

What noticeable trends are there in this group and how come they occur? 

## Overview of the Data
For this study, I chose a close friends Discord Server. There are approximately 30 people in the server and there a few key demographics about the server that feels relevant to this project. 

### The Demographics 
1. The age group of this server are all around 19 - 21
2. Most of the group was in college in 2021
3. A few of the memebers were Discord bots 


### Data Collection 
I collected the data manually from 22 people, about 73% of the server. 

The manner in which I collected the data is as follows: 

1. I made an Excel sheet that listed 22 people in random order.
2. Using the Discord search bar, I used the before and after search filters to search by year and person for every year from the start of the server until 2023. 
3. I put in the information into the respective row in Excel. 
4. Once I had found the number of messages for everyone, I then sorted the sheet from greatest number of messages 
5.  I made a copy of this Excel sheet because for the first Excel sheet, I anonymized everyone by simply putting "Person 1, Person 2..." and so on until "Person 22".  The second Excel sheet is to keep track of the names so if I ever want to change the dataset, then I can easily and accuaretly update the information. 


### Pros of the Data
1. Since I was able to double check the numbers, I verfied that the data was accurate. 
2. The Excel sheet was created by me, so I was able to make it more useful to me. 
3. Additionally, the data did not need much cleaning since I created the dataset. 

### Cons of the Data
1. It is a very small dataset, so it does not represent all of the Discord population. 
2. Since I was able to create the dataset, it did not provide much practice for data cleaning. Therefore, demonstration of that skill is limited. 
3. It was a very time consuming and inefficient way of collecting the data. 


## Processing the Data 
As already noted, data cleaning did was not required. Before the processing of the data, here is an image of what the data looked like in Excel.

I did not do much to the data once I loaded it into my Jupyter Notebook. I converted it into a DataFrame. Here is the first few rows of the DataFrame.
