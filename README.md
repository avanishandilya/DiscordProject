# DiscordProject
Discord is a messaging app that people use to connect with each other. It has grown in popularity over the years (Source 1). Personally, I have been a part of that growth in the past couple years. It interested me that around the same time the pandemic started, more and more people were joining Discord.  

I became interested in trends of Discord servers. It was very interesting to see patterns as time goes on. Therefore, I decided to create my own dataset and analyze the data with Python and Pandas.

## Overview of the Data
For this study, I chose a close friends Discord Server. There are approximately 30 people in the server and there a few key demographics about the server that feels relevant to this project. 

### The Demographics 
1. The age group of this server are all around 19 - 21
2. Most of the group was in college in 2021
3. A few of the memebers were Discord bots. 


### Data Collection 
I collected the data manually from 22 people, about 73% of the server. 

The manner in which I collected the data is as follows: 

1. I made an Excel sheet that listed 22 people in random order.
2. Using the Discord search bar, I used the before and after search filters to search by year and person for every year from the start of the server until 2023. 
3. I put in the information into the respective row in Excel. 
4. Once I had found the number of messages for everyone, I then sorted the sheet from greatest number of messages
